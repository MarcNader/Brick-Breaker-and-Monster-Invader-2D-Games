# Brick-Breaker-and-Monster-Invader-2D-Games
This is a two in one 2D games. 
I worked on this project with 2 other colleagues, the idea was to create not a single game but two and with different modes and levels using javafx. 

How to use it: 
step 1- download code 
step 2- Extract folder 
step 3- open the folder from Netbeans 
step 4- under source packages open the JavaApplication1.java and the 4 modes. 
step 5- while in JavaApplication window just hit the run button 
step 6- Have Fun ;)
